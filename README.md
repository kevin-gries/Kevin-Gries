# About Me

### Overview
I grew up in a suburb of Chicago. After I finished my Peace Corps Service in Togo, I realized that the combining economic thinking with data analytic skills is a good combination of skills for addressing our energy and environmental issues. Subsequently, I got a Masters degree in Applied Economics with a focus in Resource and Demand Analysis from University of Wisconsin. Currently, I am a research analyst at the Wisconsin Energy Conservation Corporation (WECC) whee we implement a variety of energy efficiency programs across the USA. My work focuses on:

1) using data to optimize our program's energy savings and 
2) assessing energy industry and technology trends to inform WECC's strategic direction. 

### Professional Goals:

Broadly, my professional goal is to utilize/create data analytic tools to foster the international and local local transition towards a clean, secure, and affordable energy future. Specifically, I like learning about the the electricity grid, pay-for-performance energy efficiency +  demand response, and rural electrification in developing countries. Primarily, I use R as my statistical analysis program.

### Personal:

I like to be outside, soccer, cook, play my guitar, feel healthy, and go places i haven't been before.
